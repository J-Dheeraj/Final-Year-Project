# Final demonstration checklist (10-15 minutes)

1. Identify the pinned repository commit and explain the research questions.
2. Show the vulnerable free5GC UDR behavior for unauthorized read, collection read, write, and delete.
3. Show one OpenAI-generated patch and its preserved run ID.
4. Show Go compilation and the Docker image used for validation.
5. Demonstrate runtime confirmation across all four handlers.
6. Send a benign request and show that legitimate behavior remains available.
7. Show a compile-failing GPT-5.2 patch and explain why it is rejected.
8. Show the OpenAI bypass reports: zero genuine bypasses after the stricter XSS validator.
9. Show the repeatability table and the final evidence summary.
10. Close with limitations, cost/token accounting, and post-R&D work.

Keep raw JSON reports and logs open in a second window so every headline number can be traced to evidence.
